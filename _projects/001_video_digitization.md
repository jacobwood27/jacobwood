Everything for the Wood videos has been cut into sensible clips and posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgn88s-vZEhXcXebgpeEv_bn3hjf8wEct). Additionally, everything will be placed in a few Google Photos albums with a list of links for all the albums. 

Menefee videos have been roughly cut into continuous clips. They are passed along with Google Photos only.
