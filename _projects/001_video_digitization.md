Video digitization has been a laborious process. Here is the final media count:
- 16 VHS tapes
- 15 Video8 tapes
- 18 CD/DVD/DVDminis
- 2 Cassette tapes
- 1 Floppy disk


Everything for the Wood videos has been cut into sensible clips and posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgn88s-vZEhXcXebgpeEv_bn3hjf8wEct) or shared with interested parties on Google Photos.

Menefee videos have been roughly cut into continuous clips. They are passed along with Google Photos only.
