<div class="franklin-content"><p>I find <em>lists of favorite things</em> made by individuals I respect, and strive to think more similarly to, incredibly useful sources of discovery. Here are some of these lists I&#39;ve used for identifying books to read:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8NdLoenjamLfnve7c6u8AI3X49MbORQDhZj4BpJvdY/edit">Rob Wiblin</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nickbeckstead.com/audiobooks">Nick Beckstead</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://sive.rs/book">Derek Sivers</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a similar vein, I&#39;ve attempted to keep a list of scored and ranked books I&#39;ve read. The 1-4 stars scale roughly reflects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>4 - Among the best </p>
</li>
<li><p>3 - Glad to have read  </p>
</li>
<li><p>2 - Good, but would not read again</p>
</li>
<li><p>1 - Would not recommend  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<table><tr><th align="right">Rank</th><th align="right">Title</th><th align="right">Author</th><th align="right">Stars</th><th align="right">Takeaway</th></tr><tr><td align="right">1</td><td align="right">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany</td><td align="right">William L. Shirer</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">It only takes one bad actor. Someone as charismatic as Hitler will draw a following, especially if they are fanatical and preaching to a disenfranchised populace. It is not easy to find a solution to the trap that came from Hitler’s rise to power – appeasement certainly didn’t work but kneecapping probably kicked everything off to start with. I think you could argue Hitler was a strident utilitarian who believed the world would take on its best form if he was successful; value alignment is important.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">2</td><td align="right">Thinking, Fast and Slow</td><td align="right">Daniel Kahneman</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Much of human reasoning is described well by the paradigms of System 1 &#40;fast, automatic&#41; and System 2 &#40;slow, effortful&#41;. Beware of the many biases and pitfalls that are inherent to the structure of the human mind.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</td><td align="right">Yuval Noah Harari</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Life can evolve steadily even if it makes everyone worse off &#40;hunter-gatherers to agricultural revolution&#41;. Beliefs and trust are powerful concepts humans have control over.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</td><td align="right">Robert A. Caro</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">People that can command game theory power relations in real time can do extraordinary things. Be wary of incentives in politics.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">5</td><td align="right">Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</td><td align="right">Jared Diamond</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Grain and animals native to the Fertile Crescent led to agriculture, East-West axis of Eurasia led to disseminating ideas and rapid advancement of European culture and innovations. Germs are abundant in early agriculture societies, European settlers wiped out up to 95&#37; &#40;&#33;&#41; of North America natives with their germs.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">6</td><td align="right">The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</td><td align="right">Toby  Ord</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Longtermism is very convincing, and urgent. All the risk of the next century comes from anthropogenic risk, with the bulk of that residing in the buckets of unaligned AI, engineered pandemics, and unknown anthropogenic risk. No doubt that working in this field is what I want to do.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">7</td><td align="right">Franny and Zooey</td><td align="right">J.D. Salinger</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Just be, and respect people for who they are.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">8</td><td align="right">Atlas Shrugged</td><td align="right">Ayn Rand</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">There is room for bringing about new philosophical systems, and writing a novel imagining Utopia is probably a good way to work through the details.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">9</td><td align="right">Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?</td><td align="right">Graham Allison</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">China is soon to be &#40;if not already&#41; the leading global power. 12/16 of the identified cases in which a rising power has displaced an established power have resulted in war. Probably the best way to flourish is to pull the strings and develop a symbiotic relationship, like US and UK.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">10</td><td align="right">The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</td><td align="right">Douglas Adams</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">What is the question? There is no requirement for meaning or purpose in anything.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">11</td><td align="right">The Dictator&#39;s Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics</td><td align="right">Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Alastair Smith</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Well functioning democracy makes those in power accountable to the largest &quot;winning coalition&quot;. Analyzing political leaders in the context of staying in power is probably a good starting place in almost all cases.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">12</td><td align="right">Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans</td><td align="right">Melanie Mitchell</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">As of 2019 AI has a long way to go before it actually understands anything, and the abstractions it makes now are very different than those that humans make.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">13</td><td align="right">Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones</td><td align="right">James Clear</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">You are largely a product of your habits. Relying on sheer willpower to enforce a new habit or dismiss an old one is not a good idea. Instead, use a series of strategies and environment shaping to help maintain compliance.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">14</td><td align="right">Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow</td><td align="right">Yuval Noah Harari</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Myths are good at bringing people together and giving them common cause. Humanism is the current paradigm, but all bets are off if/when we cede the future to smarter beings.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">15</td><td align="right">Ethics in the Real World: 86 Brief Essays on Things that Matter</td><td align="right">Peter Singer</td><td align="right">4</td><td align="right">Medication to improve ethical reasoning could be possible, with interesting implications. Generally ethical problems can be worked through and brought to a solution after adopting a moral framework.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">16</td><td align="right">Cat&#39;s Cradle</td><td align="right">Kurt Vonnegut</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">A big danger brought about by new, powerful technology stems from accidental misuse, not necessarily intentionally bad actors.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">17</td><td align="right">Exhalation</td><td align="right">Ted Chiang</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">It is both meaningless and unbelievably enticing to think about free will and its repercussions. And the 2nd law of thermodynamics is a real pain.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">18</td><td align="right">The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty</td><td align="right">Peter Singer</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">A single person can, and is perhaps morally bound in a utilitarian framework, to make a large difference with the global poor.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">19</td><td align="right">Brave New World</td><td align="right">Aldous Huxley</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">The state can change society’s Nash equilibrium profoundly, so that it does not agree with today’s values. What values should be preserved? Is a society full of people on Soma a utopia or a dystopia?</td></tr><tr><td align="right">20</td><td align="right">Why We&#39;re Polarized</td><td align="right">Ezra Klein</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">People have evolved to be governed by their identities through in-group out-group association. Party politics has come to a head by cleanly sorting into two groups along many of the most important identities people have.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">21</td><td align="right">Animal Farm</td><td align="right">George Orwell</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Self interested agents mixed with deceit can lead to almost universally undesirable outcomes.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">22</td><td align="right">1984</td><td align="right">George Orwell</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">It is incredibly difficult to resist the 1984 future big brother state, or any well planned state regime probably, from within.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">23</td><td align="right">The Stand</td><td align="right">Stephen King</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Good and evil only exist relevant to moral frames. Contrasting worldviews must exist in society.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">24</td><td align="right">Gang Leader for a Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes to the Streets</td><td align="right">Sudhir Venkatesh</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Incentives are everywhere and shape just about everything, even &#40;perhaps especially&#41; the guidelines and rules we use to live our lives.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">25</td><td align="right">How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of &quot;Intangibles&quot; in Business</td><td align="right">Douglas W. Hubbard</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Put numbers on things, and carry confidence intervals. Identify what variable is driving the uncertainty and focus on refining that.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">26</td><td align="right">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</td><td align="right">Philip K. Dick</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">We’ll likely never be able to tell if androids have consciousness, how do we possibly decide if they deserve moral standing?</td></tr><tr><td align="right">27</td><td align="right">The Art of Solitude</td><td align="right">Stephen Batchelor</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Extended periods of solitude should be welcomed as a great way to achieve an open mind.

This does not stop at blurring lines in science, as the same group of people did for the effects of smoking, acid rain, DDT, ozone layer, and climate science. Always ask who has a stake in the outcome.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">30</td><td align="right">Slaughterhouse-Five</td><td align="right">Kurt Vonnegut</td><td align="right">3</td><td align="right">Make your life what you will, the universe is apathetic.
