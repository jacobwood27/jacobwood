<h2 id="erin_menefee"><a href="#erin_menefee">Erin Menefee</a></h2>
<p>Erin is my fianc√© and one of the hardest working people I know. She dedicates herself wholeheartedly to her physical therapy patients and clients, often spending time off the clock to help in any way she can. She also runs relentlessly. She qualified and competed in the 2020 Olympic Marathon Trials and hopes to qualify for the 2024 Trials.  </p>
<p>From Erin I hope to learn compassion and dedication. </p>
<h2 id="my_family"><a href="#my_family">My Family</a></h2>
<p>My family has been through some challenging circumstances and has always responded with love and grace. Nothing has been insurmountable.  </p>
<p>From my family I hope to learn love and resilience.</p>
<h2 id="lex_fridman"><a href="#lex_fridman">Lex Fridman</a></h2>
<p>Lex produces the Lex Fridman podcast, among other things. He approaches every issue in his wide ranging conversations from the viewpoint that <em>love will prevail</em>. </p>
<p>From Lex I hope to learn optimism and curiosity.</p>
