# What I'm Doing Now


## Actively Searching for an Impactful Career Path
I am largely convinced by the case for [long-termism](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/) as a defining ethical view.

## Engineer at General Atomics
My work time is split between five to seven different projects across the domains of air and space systems. The aspects that I most enjoy tend to fall into the realm of first principles design and complex system modeling.

## Living in San Diego
My wonderful fianc√© and I are currently living in Pacific Beach, San Diego. We are on the lookout for a new place that allows dogs!
