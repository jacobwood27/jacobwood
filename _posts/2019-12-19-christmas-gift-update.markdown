Website development has been a little slower initially than I had hoped. That is largely due to the kickoff of the Christmas season. I've chosen to prioritize (avoiding procrastination!) preparing Christmas gifts and harboring overall Christmas spirit. The gifts that have taken up most of my free time have been:
* Video Digitization
	I've collected all the old home videos I could find around our house and have slowly been converting them to digital formats. Most of the media has been VHS and 8-track video. I've also received a bag of VHS tapes from the Menefees and have been converting those as well. The Wood videos will be hosted publicly on YouTube under my account and in a playlist called [WoodHomeVideos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgn88s-vZEhXcXebgpeEv_bn3hjf8wEct). Additionally, I've created an individual playlist for the families that make up the cast of all the videos. I'll pass that link along to each family on Christmas day. The videos are all public currently. If any problems arise I will disable comments for the videos.
	The Menefee videos need a hosting platform. Erin doesn't like the idea of a public YouTube playlist, so I am toying with these options: private (need link to access) YouTube playlist, big album in Google Photos, and shared folder in Google Drive. At this point leaning towards Google Photos album and a YouTube private playlist, but we'll see. 
	This process would not be possible without the [San Diego Public Library Digital Memory Lab](https://www.sandiego.gov/public-library/memory-lab). They have a fantastic set of equipment and capable assistants present to help you should any problem arise. The main issue with digitization is the speed, for some reason you are limited to real time ripping.
* Dad's "Birdie Brigade" Map
	The favorite activity my brother and I have with our dad is playing golf. Unfortunately, he used to be excellent at golf (handicap under 10 for a while) and it is difficult to keep up that level of performance with age. This doesn't mean that you lose any of the competetive spirit or expectations, however, and can lead to some frustration. We have started keeping score in an entirely new way when we play that we all find much more relaxed and enjoyable. Instead of scoring against each other, where each shot demands perfection, we collectively chase birdies. Everyone wins if someone manages a birdie anywhere on the course. For Christmas we are going to pose the challenge of birdie-ing (birding?) all 30 18-hole public courses in San Diego county. Along with this challenge is a map to keep track of what we have yet to do. After far too long in Gimp and Inkscape we have something that hopefully looks great on a wall and will continue to look good as we fill it out! Post on the project coming soon.
* Christmas Cookies
	In an attempt to fully embrace the Christmas spirit we've been baking cookies! This has taken more time than expected but so far the cookies have been great. Post also coming soon.
