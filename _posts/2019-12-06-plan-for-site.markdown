This website represents a turning point in my life. I recently went through the application process for a graduate school program (fingers still crossed) and the task of formalizing thoughts and accomplishments made me realize the fact that I have actively avoided this formalization, mostly due to fear of facing my own inadequacy. This site will be an attempt to push my life in a direction I want to take. 

There are a lot of things I want to get out there and hold myself accountable for. Here is the list I have generated so far:
* Conscious of actions and their consequences
*	Deliberate
*	Contact friends
*	Contribute to a greater community
*	Content generation
*	Mindfulness
*	Reviewing things
*	Reflecting on end of day and planning for next
*	Evidence tracking of things I need to do regularly
*	Not procrastinating
*	Out of comfort zone learning
*	Taking initiative
* Family contact
*	Asking for help
*	Voicing appreciation
*	Complete honesty	
* Remembering names
*	Taking tasks to a completed state
*	Learning to do things the correct way from the beginning
* Basing decisions off evidence where available

In addition to identify and tracking plans to work on all of the above points, I will be including sections of the site dedicated to other areas of interest in my life. This will hopefully provide a forum habit generation and a soapbox for another voice on the internet, one with some accountability. 

Additional sections will include:
* Everyday ethical decisions
* A resume/CV
* Stance on contemporary issues
* Plan for the future
* Inspirational people
* MOOCS
