I am adopting a philosophy of "learn the basics often" in an attempt to insure my practices coincide with best practices. Occasionally it is desirable to learn a task in a novel way and contrast the approach with the industry standard approach as a means of potentially evolving the standard approach but this philosophy should provide a chance to reflect and redirect when necessary.

This a list of courses I have taken and look forward to adding to:

UCSD edX courses make up the [Data Science MicroMasters](https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/482dee71-e4b9-4b42-a47b-3e16bb69e8f2/). Note: audited courses do not receive access to homework questions or assessments on the edX platform, so these courses are far less thorough than you might hope.
  
Mit OCW courses make up the [Bachelor of Science in Computation and Cognition (Course 6-9)](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computation-cognition-6-9/) from MIT  
"The joint bachelor’s program in 6-9 is designed to give students access to foundational and advanced material in electrical engineering and computer science, as well as in the architecture, circuits, and physiology of the brain, and computational approaches to cognition and intelligence."
